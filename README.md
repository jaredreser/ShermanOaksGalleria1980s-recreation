# ShermanOaksGalleria1980s-recreation

Sherman Oaks Fashion Square Digital Recreation

Digital reconstruction of the Sherman Oaks Galleria as it appeared in the 1980s and early 1990s.  Currently a very simple proof of concept vibecoded for threejs. Let's make a better one!


Let’s work as a community to reconstruct the Sherman Oaks Galleria as it stood in the 1980s and early 1990s—complete with Time-Out arcade, KB Toys, Sam Goody and all the iconic storefronts. It's surprising that no reconstructions of this cultural landmark exist online.

Attached to this repo is the code to run a very simple proof of concept vibecoded for threejs. Let's make a better one! There are actually few videos and pictures of this retired mall online but it was once arguably the most well-known mall in the world and featured in several movies. It was beautiful, had lots of neon, a glass elevator, and three to four levels of nostalgic 80s stores and vendors.
With the rapid advancement of AI tools, especially agentic large language models capable of coding, searching, and designing, we're approaching an era where projects like this could be completed in just a few days. Even now, combining tools like Blender with ChatGPT or Gemini and generative image models brings us closer to that goal, provided we have the right floorplans and reference photos.

Here's a general approach to how we could tackle this project:

1.	Gather Reference Materials: Collect photos, videos, and floorplans of the Galleria from the 80s and 90s. This includes movie scenes, personal photographs, and any available architectural plans.
2.	3D Modeling: Use software like Blender or SketchUp to create a basic 3D model of the mall's structure. AI can assist in generating textures and details based on the reference materials.
3.	Populate the Environment: Incorporate storefronts, signage, and interior details using generative image models. AI can help recreate store logos, window displays, and even simulate lighting conditions.
4.	Interactive Experience: Integrate the 3D model into a platform like Unity or Unreal Engine to allow for an interactive walkthrough. This could eventually be adapted for VR platforms, providing an immersive experience.
5.	Community Collaboration: Engage with others who have memories or materials related to the Galleria. Their input can enhance the accuracy and richness of the reconstruction.

If anyone has memories, photos, or other resources related to the Sherman Oaks Galleria, or is interested in collaborating on this project, I'd love to connect. Together, we can bring this iconic mall back to life in the digital realm!

Included here in this github repo is a 3D simulation using threejs.
•  Upscaling signage
•  Placing assets from online libraries (or generating them)
•  Adding ambient mall audio and people walking around
•  Exporting a working VR package

The mall was built in 1980 in Sherman Oaks California. Bought in the mid 90s for 50 million. It was torn down and rebuilt in 1998 for 200 million. There is a wikipedia page for the mall.

Sherman Oaks Galleria (1990s) - Look and Feel
The overall vibe should be a blend of late 80s holdovers and burgeoning 90s aesthetics. Think bright, airy, and bustling with a specific kind of consumer energy unique to that decade.

Architectural Style & Layout
Multi-level Design: The Galleria was famous for its multiple levels (typically two or three main shopping floors) connected by escalators and often a prominent central glass elevator.
Central Atrium/Courts: Large, open central areas were key. These spaces were often flooded with natural light from skylights or large glass ceilings. Fountains or water features were common focal points.

Storefronts:
Variety: A mix of anchor department stores (like Robinsons-May, The Broadway), smaller chain stores (Contempo Casuals, Structure, Sam Goody, Waldenbooks, Foot Locker), and unique boutiques.
Design: Storefronts would have varied greatly. Some might have had bold, geometric entrances, while others would be more traditional. Lots of glass, bright signage (some neon, some backlit).
Flooring: Likely large, polished tiles – perhaps in shades of beige, off-white, or a subtle terrazzo pattern.
Railings: Often brass, chrome, or painted metal with glass panels.
Seating Areas: Scattered benches, possibly in materials like wood, laminate, or upholstered vinyl, often grouped around planters.
Planters: Large built-in planters with live (or very convincing artificial) plants and trees were a huge part of the 80s/90s mall aesthetic, adding a touch of "nature" indoors.

Color Palette & Materials
Dominant Colors:
Pastels & Neons (fading but present): Hints of teal, dusty rose, lavender, and peach, possibly mixed with brighter pops of neon in signage or specific store branding.
Earthy Tones & Neutrals: Beige, cream, terracotta, and various shades of grey would have been common for larger surfaces like walls and floors.
Primary Colors: Bold reds, blues, and yellows in some store designs and mall graphics.

Materials:
Glass: Abundant – skylights, storefronts, railings, elevators.
Mirrored Surfaces: Mirrored columns or wall sections were very trendy.
Brass & Chrome: For railings, elevator details, light fixtures, and store accents.
Laminate & Formica: Especially for food court tables and some store fixtures.
Stucco/Textured Walls: Common for interior wall finishes.
Tile: For flooring and some wall accents.
